# Weather-Data-Analysis-
Weather Data Analysis
Project Description

This project focuses on the analysis of fictional weather data, simulating a dataset that might be obtained from sources like Visual Crossing Weather. The goal is to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing key weather trends and statistics over time.

The Python script simulates the process of acquiring weather data, prepares it for analysis, and then generates charts illustrating average temperatures, extreme weather phenomena, and overall climate trends.
Technologies

    Python 3.x

    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

    matplotlib: For creating static data visualizations.

    seaborn: For creating aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations.

    numpy: For numerical operations and data generation.

Data

The data used in this project is synthetic and generated by the weather_analysis.py script. Its structure is designed to mimic typical weather datasets, including columns such as: Date, TempMax, TempMin, Precipitation, WindSpeed, Humidity, and Conditions.

The script intentionally introduces some missing values and errors in the data to demonstrate robust data cleaning practices.
File Structure

    weather_analysis.py: The main Python script for data generation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

    weather_data.csv: A CSV file containing the generated (synthetic) weather data. This file is automatically created by weather_analysis.py on the first run if it does not exist.

    README.md: This file, containing the project description and instructions.

How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

    Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x).

    Install the required libraries, if you don't have them already:

    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

    Run the analysis script:

        Open your terminal or command prompt.

        Navigate to the directory where you saved weather_analysis.py.

        Execute the script using:

        python weather_analysis.py

        On the first run, the script will generate the weather_data.csv file. It will then load the data, perform the analysis, and display the plots in separate windows.

Key Analyses and Visualizations

The weather_analysis.py script performs the following main analyses and visualizations:

    Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, converts data types (e.g., dates, numerical values), and removes duplicates. It also addresses potential data quality issues like negative precipitation values.

    Overall Averages: Calculates the average maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and daily precipitation across the entire dataset.

    Monthly Averages/Totals: Aggregates data to show monthly average temperatures (max and min) and total precipitation, useful for identifying seasonal patterns.

    Extreme Weather Events: Identifies the hottest, coldest, and wettest days in the dataset.

    Yearly Climate Trends: Computes yearly average maximum and minimum temperatures to observe long-term trends.

    Frequency of Weather Conditions: Counts the occurrences of different weather conditions (e.g., Clear, Rain, Snow).

    Visualizations:

        Monthly Average Temperature Trends: A line chart showing the progression of average maximum and minimum temperatures over months.

        Monthly Total Precipitation: A bar chart illustrating the total precipitation for each month.

        Yearly Average Temperatures: A line chart showing the average yearly temperatures, which can highlight climate trends.

        Frequency of Weather Conditions: A bar chart displaying the distribution of different weather conditions.
